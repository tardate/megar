Mega API Javascript Refeence Implementation

The files contained in this folder are not used by the Megar gem.

These are the source Javascript files obtained from mega.co.nz in the course of megar development,
and are only stored here to provide some traceability when the javascript implementation changes.
This is only important while the Javascript implementation is the only concrete reference to details
of the Mega API. It will become redundant when the Mega API is formally lanched with detailed
documentation.
